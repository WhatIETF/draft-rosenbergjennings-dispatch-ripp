.# Abstract

This document specifies the Realtime Internet Peering Protocol
(RIPP). RIPP is used to provide telephony peering between a trunking
provider (such as a telco), and a trunking consumer (such as an
enterprise, cloud PBX provider, cloud contact center provider, and so
on). RIPP is an alternative to SIP, SDP and RTP for this use case, and
is designed as a web application using HTTP/3. Using HTTP/3 allows trunking
consumers to more easily build their applications on top of cloud
platforms, such as AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, all of which are
heavily focused on HTTP based services. RIPP also addresses many of
the challenges of traditional SIP-based trunking. Most notably, it
mandates secure caller ID via STIR, and provides automated trunk
provisioning as a mandatory protocol component. RIPP supports both
direct and "BYO" trunk configurations. Since it runs over HTTP/3, it
works through NATs and firewalls with the same ease as HTTP does, and
easily supports load balancing with elastic cluster expansion and
contraction, including auto-scaling - all because it is nothing more
than an HTTP application. RIPP also provides built in mechanisms for
migrations of calls between RIPP client and server instances, enabling
failover with call preservation.

# Introduction

## Background

Cloud computing platforms, such as those provided by Amazon, Azure,
and Google, have now become mainstream for the development of software
applications. These platforms are targeted at enabling web
applications, and as such many of their features are based on the
usage of HTTP.

One example are HTTP load balancers. Cloud computing platforms provide
highly scalable, geographically distributed, redundant load
balancers. These load balancers can monitor the state of downstream
servers and can uniformly distribute load amongst them. The load
balancers can compensate for failure of individual nodes and send new
traffic to other nodes.

Autoscaling is another example. The cloud computing platforms can
automatically add new instances of a server backend, or remove them,
and automatically configure the load balancers to include them in the
pool of available servers.

Yet another example is Kubernetes, which allows web-based applications
to be deployed into containers (typically Docker), with load
balancing, scaling, and HTTP request routing.

Another example are HTTP tracing tools, which facilitate the tracing
of requests through distributed microservices. These tools can
autogenerate sequence diagrams and facilitate in troubleshooting.

Yet another example are API gateways (such as APIGee and Kong), which
provide authentication and authorization, provisioning of
applications, rate limiting, analytics, sandboxing for testing,
embedded documentation, and so on.

And yet another example are denial-of-service prevention techniques,
typically done using BGP peering and re-routing. Though in principle
these techniques can work for VoIP, they are deployed in conjunction
with the load balancers which represent the entry point into these
cloud provider networks. Consequently, the protections these cloud
providers offer do not extend to applications which merely use these
platforms for virtual machines. 

A more recent technology are service meshes, such as Istio, which
utilize sidecar HTTP proxies to facilitate inter-service
communications. These systems come with robust control planes which
enable additional routing features, such as canary deploys, percentage
based routing, and so on. 

## Problem Statement

Unfortunately, there are many applications being deployed into these
cloud platforms which require interconnection with the public switched
telephone network (PSTN). Examples of such applications include cloud
PBXs, cloud contact centers, cloud meetings applications, and so
on. Furthermore, commerce websites would like to allow customers
to call into the telephone network for customer support.

In order for these applications to connect to the PSTN, they typically
deploy Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [@RFC3261] based servers -
SBCs, SIP proxies, and softswitches, to provide this
interconnection. Unfortunately, SIP based applications cannot make use
of the many capabilities these cloud platforms afford to HTTP based
applications. These SIP servers are usually deployed on bare metal or
VMs at best. Application developers must build their own load
balancing, HA, failover, clustering, security, and scaling
technologies, rather than using the capabilities of these platforms.

This has creating a barrier to entry, particularly for applications
such as websites which are not expert in VoIP
technologies. Furthermore, it has meant that VoIP applications have
been unable to take advantage of the many technology improvements that
have come to networking and protocol design since the publication of
RFC 3261 in 2002.

In addition, SIP trunking has suffered from complex provisioning
operations, oftentimes requiring the exchange of static IPs and
ports. These operations are almost never self-service and
consequently, SIP trunk turn ups can take weeks. Finally, perhaps the
biggest challenge with SIP trunking has been its abuse for injecting
robocalls. 

## Solution

The goal of RIPP is to enable one administrative domain to send and
receive voice calls with another domain. In this regard, RIPP replaces
the usage of SIP, SDP offer/answer [@RFC3264] and RTP [@RFC3550] for
this particular use case. RIPP does not actually deprecate or replace
SIP itself, as it covers only a small subset of the broader
functionality that SIP provides. It is designed to be the minimum
protocol required to interconnect voice between a trunking provider
and a domain wishing to access trunking services.

In order to make use of new HTTP based technologies as described
above, RIPP uses HTTP/3 [@I-D.ietf-quic-http], but is not an
extension to it. The goal is to ride the coattails of advancement in
HTTP based technologies without requiring them to do anything special
for the benefit of VoIP. This means that RIPP inherits the benefits of
classic HTTP deployments - easy load balancing, easy expansion and
contraction of clusters (including auto-scaling), standard techniques
for encryption, authentication, and denial-of-service prevention, and
so on.

RIPP also includes a built-in mechanism for provisioning, as a
mandatory component of the specification. This enables RIPP trunks to
be self-provisioned through web portals, and instantly turned on in
production. This will help accelerate the adoption of
telecommunications services across the web.

## Why Now?

The idea of re-converging HTTP and SIP is certainly not new, and indeed
has been discussed in the hallways of IETF for many years. However,
several significant limitations made this previously infeasible:

1. HTTP utilized TCP, which meant that it created head-of-line
blocking which would delay lost packets rather than just discard
them. This will often provide intolerable latency for VoIP.

2. HTTP was request response, allowing the client to send requests and
receive a response. There as no way for a server to asynchronously
send information to the client in an easy fashion.

HTTP2 [@RFC7540] addressed the second of these with the introduction of pushes
and long running requests. However, its usage of TCP was still a
problem. This has finally been addressed with the arrival of QUIC
[@I-D.ietf-quic-transport] and
HTTP/3. QUIC is based on UDP, and it introduces the concept of a stream
that can be set up with zero RTT. These streams are carried over UDP,
and though are still reliable, there is no head of line blocking
across streams. This change has made it possible for HTTP to support
VoIP applications.


# Solution Requirements

The protocol defined here is based on the following requirements:

REQ1: The solution shall not require extensions or modifications to
HTTP/3.

REQ2: The solution shall work with both L4 and L7 HTTP load balancers

REQ3: The solution shall work in ways that are compatible with best
practices for load balancers and proxies supporting HTTP/3, and not
require any special changes to these load balancers in order to
function.

REQ4: The solution should hide the number of servers behind the load
balancer, allow the addition or removal of servers from the cluster at
will, and not expose any of this information to the peer

REQ5: The solution shall enable the usage of autoscaling technologies
used in cloud platforms, without any special consideration for RIPP -
its just a web app

REQ6: The solution shall provide call preservation in the face of
failures of the server or client. It is acceptable for a brief blip of
media due to transient packet loss, but thats it

REQ7: The solution shall support built-in migration, allowing a server
to quickly shed load in order to be restarted or upgraded, without any
impact to calls in progress

REQ8: The solution will be easy to interoperate with SIP

REQ9: The solution shall be incrementally deployable - specifically it
must be designed for easy implementation by SBCs and easy deployment
by PSTN termination and origination providers who do not utilize cloud
platforms

REQ10: The solution shall require authentication and encryption, with no opportunity to disable them. Furthermore, it will require secure callerID, with no provision for insecure callerID 

REQ11: The solution shall provide low latency for media

REQ12: The solution shall support only audio, but be extensible to
video or other media in the future

REQ13: The solution must support secure caller ID out of the gate and
not inherit any of the insecure techniques used with SIP

REQ14: The solution shall include mandatory-to-implement provisioning
operations 


# Design Approaches

To meet the requirements stated above, RIPP makes several fundamental
changes compared to SIP. These changes, and their motivations, are
described in the sections below.

## HBH, not E2E

SIP was designed as an end-to-end protocol. As such, it explicitly
incorporates features which presume the existence of a network of
elements - proxies and registrars in particular. SIP provides many
features to facilitate this - Via headers, record-routing, and so on.

HTTP on the other hand - is strictly a hop-by-hop technology. Though
it does support the notion of proxies (ala the CONNECT method for
reverse proxies), the protocol is fundamentally designed to be between
a client and an authoritative server. What happens beyond that
authoritative server is beyond the scope of HTTP, and can (and often
does) include additional HTTP transactions.

Consequently, in order to reside within HTTP, RIPP follows the same
pattern and only concerns itself with HBH behaviours. Like HTTP, a RIPP
server can of course act as a RIPP client and further connect calls to
downstream elements. However, such behavior requires no additional
specification and is therefore not discussed by RIPP.

## Client-Server, not Agent-to-Agent

SIP is based fundamentally on the User Agent, and describes the
communications between a pair of user agents. Either user agent can
initiate requests towards the other. SIP defines the traditional role
of client and server as bound to a specific transaction.

HTTP does not operate this way. In HTTP, one entity is a client, and
the other is a server. There is no way for the server to send messages
asynchronously towards the client. HTTP/3 does enable two distinct
techniques that facilitate server messaging towards the client. But to
use them, RIPP must abide by HTTP/3 rules, and that means distinct
roles for clients and servers. Clients must always initiate
connections and send requests, not servers.

To handle this, RIPP specifies that the domain associated with the
caller implements the RIPP client, and the domain receiving the calls
is the RIPP server. For any particular call, the roles of client and
server do not change. To facilitate calls in either direction, a
domain can implement both RIPP client and RIPP server roles. However,
there is no relationship between the two directions.

## Signaling and Media Together

One of the most fundamental design properties of SIP was the
separation of signalling and media. This was fundamental to the success
of SIP, since it enabled high quality, low latency media between
endpoints inside of an enterprise or consumer domain.

This design technique is quite hard to translate to HTTP, especially
when considering load balancing and scaling techniques. HTTP load
balancing is effective because it treats each request/response pair as
an independent action which can route to any number of backends. In
essence, the request/response transaction is atomic, and
consequentially RIPP needs to operate this way as well. 

Though SIP envisioned that signalling and media separation would also apply to
inter-domain calls, in practice this has not happened. Inter-domain
interconnect - used primarily for interconnection with the PSTN - is
done traditionally with SBCs which terminate and re-originate
media. Since this specification is targeted solely at these peering
use cases, RIPP fundamentally combines signalling and media together on
the same connection. To ensure low latency, it uses multiple
independent request/response transactions - each running in parallel
over unique QUIC streams - to transmit media. 


## URIs not IPs

SIP is full of IP addresses and ports. They are contained in Via
headers, in Route and Record-Route headers. In SDP. In Contact
headers. The usage of IPs is one of the main reasons why SIP is so
difficult to deploy into cloud platforms. These platforms are based on
the behavior of HTTP which has been based on TCP connections and
therefore done most of its routing at the connection layer, and not
the IP layer.

Furthermore, modern cloud platforms are full of NATs and private IP
space, making them inhospitable to SIP based applications which still
struggle with NAT traversal.

HTTP of course does not suffer from this. In general, "addressing", to
the degree it exists at all, is done with HTTP URIs. RIPP follows this
pattern. RIPP - as a web application that uses HTTP/3 - does not use or
convey any IP addresses or ports. Furthermore, the client never
provides addressing to the server - all traffic is sent in the reverse
direction over the connection. 

## OAuth not MTLS or private IP

When used in peering arrangements today, authentication for the SIP
connections is typically done using mutual TLS. It is also often the
case that security is done at the IP layer, and sometimes even via
dedicated MPLS connections which require
pre-provisioning. Unfortunately, these techniques are quite
incompatible with how modern cloud platforms work.

HTTP - due to its client-server nature, uses asymmetric techniques
for authentication. Most notably, certificate based authentication is
done by the client to verify that it is speaking to the server it
thinks it should be speaking to. For the server to identify the
client, modern platforms make use of OAuth2.0. Though OAuth is not
actually an authentication protocol, the use of OAuth has allowed
authentication to be done out of band via separate identity servers which
produce OAuth tokens which can then be used for authentication of the
client.

Consequently, RIPP follows this same approach. For each call, one
domain acts as the client, and the other, as the server. When acting
as a server, the domain authenticates itself with TLS and verifies the
client with OAuth tokens. For calls in the reverse direction, the
roles are reversed.

To make it possible to easily pass calls in both directions, RIPP
allows one domain to act as the customer of another, the trunking
provider. The customer domain authenticates with the provider and
obtains an OAuth token using traditional techniques. RIPP then allows
the customer domain to automatically create a bearer token for inbound
calls and pass it to the provider.


## TLS not SRTP or SIPS

SIP has provided encryption of both signalling and media, through the
usage of SIP over TLS and SIPS, and SRTP, respectively. Unfortunately,
these have not been widely deployed. The E2E nature of SRTP has made
keying an ongoing challenge, with multiple technologies developed over
the years. SIP itself has seen greater uptake of TLS transport, but
this remains uncommon largely due to the commonality of private IP
peering as an alternative.

Because of the HBH nature of RIPP, security is done fundamentally at
the connection level - identically to HTTP. Since media is also
carrier over the HTTP connection, both signalling and media are covered
by the connection security provided by HTTP/3.

Because of the mandatory usage of TLS1.3 with HTTP/3, and the expected
widespread deployment of HTTP/3, running VoIP on top of HTTP/3 will bring
built-in encryption of media and signalling between peering domains,
which is a notable improvement over the current deployment
situation. It is also necessary in order to utilize HTTP/3.

Because of this, RIPP does not support SRTP. If a client receives a
SIP call with SRTP, it must terminate the SRTP and decrypt media
before sending it over RIPP. This matches existing practice in many
cases. 

## Authenticated CallerID

Robocalling is seeing a dramatic rise in volume, and efforts to combat
it continue. One of the causes of this problem is the ease of which
SIP enables one domain to initiate calls to another domain without
authenticated caller ID.

With RIPP, we remedy this by requiring the client and servers to
implement STIR. Since RIPP is meant for peering between providers (and
not client-to-server connections), STIR is applicable. RIPP clients
must either insert a signed passport, or pass one through if it
exists. Similarly, RIPP servers must act as verifying parties and
reject any calls that omit a passport.

* CJ - Need to check we have all the things needed in an Passport.

## Calls Separate from Connections

In SIP, there is a fuzzy relationship between calls and
connections. In some cases, connection failures cause call
terminations, and vice a versa.

HTTP, on the other hand, very clearly separates the state of the
resource being manipulated, with the state of the HTTP connection used
to manipulate it. This design principle is inherited by
RIPP. Consequently, call state on both client and server exist
independently from the connections which manipulate them. This allows
for greater availability my enabling connections for the same call to
move between machines in the case of failures.

## Path Validation, not ICE

HTTP/3 is designed to work through NAT as a client-server protocol. It
has built in techniques for dealing with NAT re-bindings, IP address
changes due to a client moving between networks (e.g., wifi to
cellular data). It has built in path validation that ensures that HTTP
cannot be used for amplification attacks.

SIP has, over the years, solved these problems to some degree, but not
efficiently nor completely. To work with HTTP, RIPP must utilize the
HTTP approaches for these problems. Consequently, RIPP does not
utilize ICE and has no specific considerations for NAT traversal, as
these are handled by HTTP/3 itself.

RIPP is used between a RIPP trunk provider and a RIPP trunk
consumer. Both entities implement the RIPP client and RIPP server
roles; the latter to receive calls, and the former to send them.

RIPP is also designed such that all communications between the RIPP
client and the RIPP server can easily sit behind a typical HTTP load
balancer, as shown below:

~~~

Since both the trunk provider and trunk consumer implement the client
and server roles, both entities will typically have a load balancer - perhaps a server component, or a cloud-based service, 
used to receive incoming calls. This is not required, of course. It is
worth restating that this load balancer is NOT specific to RIPP - it
is any off-the-shelf HTTP load balancer which supports HTTP/3. No
specific support for RIPP is required. RIPP is just a usage of HTTP. 

Because RIPP clients and servers are nothing more than HTTP/3
applications, the behavior or RIPP is specified entirely by describing
how various RIPP procedures map to the core HTTP/3 primitives available
to applications - opening connections, closing connections, sending
requests and responses, receiving requests and responses, and setting
header fields and bodies. That's it.


# Terminology

This specification follows the terminology of HTTP/3 - specifically:

RIPP Client: The entity that initiates a call, by acting as an HTTP
client.

RIPP Server: The entity that receives a call, by acting as an HTTP
server.

RIPP Connection: An HTTP connection between a RIPP client and RIPP
server.

RIPP Endpoint: Either a RIPP client or RIPP server.

RIPP Peer: An endpoint.  When discussing a particular endpoint, "peer"
refers to the endpoint that is remote to the primary subject of
discussion.

This specification defines the following additional terms:

RIPP Trunk: A container for calls between a trunking provider and
trunking consumer. A RIPP trunk is identified by a pair of URI - the
RIPP Trunk Provider URI (hosted by the trunking provider) and the RIPP
Trunk Consumer URI (hosted by the trunking consumer). RIPP trunks act
as a unit of policy and capabilities, including rules such as rate
limits, allowed phone numbers, and so on.

Call: A VoIP session established by a RIPP client for the purposes of
exchanging audio and signalling information. A call is always
associated with a RIPP trunk. 

Trunking Consumer: An administrative entity that utilizes trunking
services from the trunking provider. The relationship between the
trunking consumer and trunking provider is static and does not vary
from call to call. (e.g., Verizon would be the trunking provider to an
enterprise consumer, and the enterprise would be the trunking consumer of
Verizon. A trunking consumer implements a RIPP client to initiate
calls to the trunking provider, and a RIPP server to receive them. 

Trunking Provider: The administrative entity that provides telephony
trunking services to the trunking consumer. The relationship between
the trunking consumer and trunking provider is static and does not
vary from call to call. (e.g., Verizon would be the trunking provider
to an enterprise, and the enterprise would be the trunking customer of
Verizon. The trunking provider implements a RIPP server to receive
calls from the trunking consumer, and a RIPP client to send calls to
the trunking consumer

Trunking Customer: The administrative entity which purchases trunking
services from the trunking provider. The trunking customer may be the
same as the trunking consumer - such as an enterprise purchasing and
then consuming trunking services from a telco. Or, it can be different
- such as an enterprise purchasing trunking services from a telco, and
then authorizing a cloud PBX or cloud contact center provider to
consume those trunking services on their behalf.

RIPP Trunk Provider URI: An HTTP URI hosted by the trunking provider, which
represents the RIPP trunk from its perspective.

RIPP Trunk Consumer URI: An HTTP URI hosted by the trunking consumer, which
represents the RIPP trunk from its perspective.

Byway: A bidirectional byte stream between a RIPP provider and
consumer. A Byway passes its data through a long-running HTTP request
and a long-running HTTP response. Byways are used for signalling and
media.


# Overview of Operation

RIPP begins with a configuration phase. This configuration  phase occurs
when an OAuth2.0 client application (such as a softswitch, cloud PBX,
cloud contact center, etc) wishes to enable trunking customers to
provision RIPP trunks against a trunking provider. The trunking
provider acts as the resource provider in OAuth2.0
parlance. Consequently, The configuration phase is identical to the way
in which client applications register with resource providers in
OAuth2.0, the details of which are beyond the scope of this
specification, but expected to follow existing best practices used by
web applications.

The next step is provisioning. Once a trunking customer has obtained access to 
services from a trunking provider (by purchasing them , for example), the trunking customer can perform
provisioning. Provisioning is the process by which a trunking customer
connects a RIPP trunk from a trunking provider to trunking
consumer. Provisioning is accomplished using  
OAuth2.0 code authorization techniques. In the case of RIPP, the
OAuth resource owner is the trunking customer. The OAuth client is the
RIPP implementation within the trunking consumer. The resource server
is the RIPP implementation in the trunking provider.

To provision a RIPP trunk, the trunking customer will visit a web page
hosted by the trunking consumer, and typically click on a button
labeled with their trunking provider. This will begin the OAuth 2
authorization code flow. The trunking customer will authenticate with
the trunking provider. The trunking provider authorizes the access,
generates an authorization code, and generates a RIPP trunk provider
URI. The provider URI is included in a new OAuth parameter defined by
this specification, and is returned as a parameter in the authorization
response. The trunking consumer trades the authorization code for a
refresh and access token, and stores the provider URI. Finally, the
trunking consumer mints a bearer token associated with the new RIPP
trunk, and also mints a RIPP trunk consumer URI for receiving calls
from the provider on this trunk. Both of these are passed to the
trunking provider via a POST operation to /consumerTrunk on the RIPP
trunk provider URI. 

The usage of the OAuth2.0 flows enables the trunking consumer and
trunking customer to be the same (i.e., a cloud PBX provider purchases
services from a telco), or different (i.e., an enterprise customer has
purchased trunking services from a telco, and wishes to
provision them into a cloud contact center that acts as the trunking
consumer). The latter is often referred to informally as "BYOSIP" in
traditional SIP trunking and is explicitly supported by RIPP using
OAuth2.0.

Once provisioned, both sides obtain capability declarations for the
RIPP trunk by performing a GET to /capAdv of its peers trunk URI. The
capabilities declaration is a simple document, whose syntax is
described in Section (#syntax). It conveys the receive capabilities of
the entity sending it, and includes parameters like maximum bitrate
for audio. This process is optional, and each parameter has a
default. Either side can update its capabilities for the RIPP trunk at
any time, and trigger a fresh GET via an HTTP push. Capability
declarations occur outside of a call, are optional, and convey static
receive capabilities which are a fixed property of the RIPP
trunk. Consequently, capability declaration is significantly different
from SDP offer/answer.

Either the trunking consumer or provider can initiate calls by posting
to the /calls on RIPP trunk URI of its peer.
The request contains the target phone number in the
request URI and an Identity header field in the HTTP Request. The
Identity header field is identical in syntax and semantics to the SIP
Identity header field defined in [@RFC8224], just carried in HTTP
instead of SIP. This request returns a globally unique call URI in the
Location header field of a 201 response sent by the server. Typically
the response will also include a session cookie, bound to the call, to
facilitate sticky session routing in HTTP proxies. This allows all
further signalling and media to reach the same RIPP server that
handled the initial request, while facilitating failover should that
server go down.

Once a call has been created, a pair of long-lived HTTP transactions
is initiated from the client to the server for purposes of
signalling. One is a GET, retrieving call events from its peer. THe
other is a PUT, sending call events to its peer. Each of these
produces a unidirectional data stream, one in the forwards direction,
one in the reverse. These are called byways. HTTP/3
ensures zero RTT for setup of these byways.

Signaling commands are encoded into the signalling byway using
streaming JSON in both directions. Each JSON object encodes an event
and its parameters. Events are defined for alerting, connected, ended,
migrate, keepalive, and transfer-and-takeback. 

The media byways carry a simple binary encoding in both
directions. Even though data can flow in both directions, a media
byway is unidirectional in terms of media transmission. A forward
media byway carries media from the client to the server, and a reverse
byway carries media from the server to the client. To eliminate HOL
blocking for media, a media packet is sent on a media byway when it is
first established. After the first packet, the client cannot be sure a
subsequent packet will be delayed due to the ordering guarantees
provided by HTTP/3 within a stream. To combat this, both sides
acknowledge the receipt of each packet using an ACK message sent over
the media byways, in the opposite direction of the
media. Consequently, in a forward media byway, ACK messages are
carried from server to client, and in a reverse media byway, they are
carried from client to server.  Once a media packet is acknowledged,
the media byway can be used once again without fear of HOL
blocking. Because each media packet is acknowledged independently,
each side can compute statistics on packet losses and
delays. Consequently, the equivalent of RTCP sender and receiver
reports are not needed.

RIPP defines some basic requirements for congestion control at the
client side. Specifically, clients drop media packets if there are too
many media byways in the blocked state.

RIPP provides a simple technique for allowing a call to
seamlessly migrate from one client instance to another on a different
host, or from one server instance to another on a different host. For a
client, it need only end the byways in use for the call and
re-initiate from a different instance. Similarly, a server can request
migration, and this triggers the client to perform this same
action. The call state persists independently of the state of the HTTP
connection or the byways embedded in HTTP transactions, so that a
reconnect can continue where things left off.

Finally, RIPP trunks can be destroyed by a trunking consumer by
issuing a DELETE against the RIPP trunk provider URI. 


# Example

This section describes a typical example where one company, Acme, is
using a cloud calling service -  Webex - and gets PSTN trunking from the
provider Comcast.

The sequence diagram for the outbound call flow is here:

<{{seq-diagram-out.txt}}

The first stage is for Webex to set up their service to be able to work as
an OAuth Client, working with Comcast as the Authorization
Server, and to obtain the baseURI that Comcast uses for RIPP authorization. Assume
that this is "https\://ripp.comcast.com". The next stage is the admin
from ACME logs on to their Webex account and selects Comcast as the RIPP
provider.  This will cause the OAUTH dance and the admin will end up
having approved Webex to use Acme's account at Comcast for RIPP. Webex
will have received an OAuth access and refresh token from Comcast and be
passed the new Provider Trunk URI. At this point, provisioning is complete
and calls can start. Assume the provider trunk URI returned is
"https\://ripp.comcast.com/trunks/123".

Webex will start by setting up for incoming calls at
"https\://ripp.webex/trunks/abc" with an opaque security token of
"secret1234". This is done by making a HTTP PUT to
https\://ripp.comcast.com/trunks/123/consumerTrunk with a JSON
body of:

~~~
{
"consumerTrunkURI":"https://ripp.webex/trunks/abc" ,
"consumerToken":"secret1234"
}
~~~

The Comcast server will then find out the advertised capability of the
Webex trunk by doing a 
GET to https\://ripp.webex/trunks/abc/capAdv and using the
secret1234 as an authorization token. Webex supports the default values
but also support G.729 as an additional codec. It returns a JSON body of:

~~~
{  "audio/g729": true }
~~~

Similarly, the Webex server will find out the advertised capability of
the trunk by doing a GET to
https\://ripp.comcast.com/trunks/123/capAdv, using its OAuth
token. In this case, the response is empty, indicating that the
capabilities are all default.

At this point we are ready for inbound or outbound calls.

## Inbound Call

A PSTN calls arrives at Comcast that is routed to the this trunk via a
Comcast SBC that will convert it from SIP to RIPP. The SBC knows which
codecs the trunk supports (G.729, Opus and G.711) and can immediately send the SIP answer in
a 183. It can then can make an HTTP post to the consumer trunk URI to set up the
incoming call. This is done by doing a POST to
"https\://ripp.webex/trunks/abc/calls&target=14085551212@e164.arpa" using the authorization token
"secret1234". This will return a new call URI for this call of
"https\://ripp.webex/call/xyz".

At this point the SBC can make a long poll GET and PUT to
"https\://ripp.webex/call/xyz/events" to receive and send signaling
events for
this call. The SBC will also open a number of media byways by making POST
requests to "https\://ripp.webex/call/xyz/media-forward" and
"https\://ripp.webex/call/xyz/media-reverse" to send and receive media.

For each of the media-forward byways, the Comcast SBC will send a BywayPreamble
that tells the other side meta data about what will be sent on this
byway. For the media-reverse byways, the Webex server will send the
BywayPreamble. The BywayPreamble contains the name of the codec, the
base sequence number, frameTime, and baseTime. After this BywayPreamble,
media frames can be sent that contain a seqOffset number, media length,
and then the media data. The receiver compute the time sequence number
for the frame by adding the baseSeqNum for the byway to the seqOffset
for the frame. The timestamp for the media is computed using the
baseTime for the byway plus the packeTime multiplied by the seqNum.

The data from the "https\://ripp.webex/call/xyz/events" request will be
an infinite JSON array of Events. When the Webex server answers the
call, the event returned would look like:

~~~
{ "name":"accepted" }
~~~

## Outbound Call

For Webex to make it outbound call, it is the same as the inbound call
other than the provider trunk URI is used. The Webex server would act as
a client and do a HTTP POST to
"https\://ripp.comcast.com/trunks/123/calls&target=14085551212@e164.arpa" to create a call URI
of "https\://ripp.comcast.com/call/c789". From that point the flow is
roughly the same as inbound with the client and server roles reversed.

## End of call 

If the call is ended on the server side, server sends a terminated event
with the ended flag set to true then waits a small time for client to
close the connection then closes the connection.

If the call is ended on the client side, the client sends a terminated
event with the ended flag set to true and then closes the connection. In
either case the event looks like:

~~~
{ "name":"terminated", "ended": true }
~~~


# Detailed Behaviours

This section provides an overview of the operation of RIPP.

## Configuration

RIPP configuration happens when a trunking consumer wishes to be able
to provision, on demand, new RIPP trunks with a trunking
provider.

One example use case is that of an enterprise, which has deployed an
IP PBX of some sort within its data centers. Once deployed, the
enterprise needs to enable the PBX to place and receive calls towards
the PSTN. The enterprise contracts with a RIPP trunking provider. All
of this happens as a precursor to configuration. At the end of the
contracting process, the enterprise administrator will visit the
configuration web page, and be able to register their enterprise
PBX. This process will typically return a client-ID, client-secret, and
authorization endpoint URL. The administrator manually enters these
into the configuration of their PBX. [[OPEN ISSUE: OpenID connect?]]

As another example use case, a cloud contact center, cloud PBX
provider, or any other saas application which wishes to obtain
trunking services, can contract with a RIPP trunking provider. In a
similar process to the enterprise case above, the administrator
obtains a clientID, client-secret, and authorization endpoint URL
which are configured into their service.

In the final use case, an enterprise administrator has purchased
trunking services from a RIPP trunking provider. They separately have
purchased cloud PBX, cloud contact center, or another saas service
which requires connectivity to a RIPP trunk. In this case, the cloud
PBX, cloud contact center, or other saas service acts as the RIPP
trunk consumer. The RIPP trunk consumer would configure itself as a
client with a variety of RIPP trunking providers, and for each, obtain
the clientID, client-secret and authorization URL. This will allow the
customers of the RIPP trunking consumer to provision RIPP trunks
automatically, and point them to the RIPP trunking consumer. 


## RIPP Trunk Provisioning

Once a RIPP consumer has been configured as an OAuth client
application with a RIPP provider, a RIPP customer can provision a RIPP
trunk on-demand using a web form. RIPP consumers will typically provide a
self-service web form for such provisioning, since self-service and
instant provisioning are key goals of RIPP.

The RIPP customer visits this web form, and selects their
provider. The RIPP consumer would then initiate an OAuth2.0
authorization code flow. This utilizes the clientID, client-secret
and authorization endpoint URL configured previously. The RIPP
customer will authenticate to the RIPP provider, and authorize
creation of a new RIPP trunk. 

Once the RIPP customer authorizes creation of a RIPP trunk, the RIPP
provider MUST generate an authorization code and follow the procedures
defined in [@RFC6749] for the authorization code grant
flow. Furthermore, the RIPP provider MUST mint a new URI identifying
this new RIPP trunk. This URI MUST contain a path component, and MUST
NOT contain any URI parameters. This URI MUST be an HTTPS URI, and
HTTP/3 MUST be supported for this URI. The path component MUST be a
globally unique identifier for this trunk, and not depend on the authority
component as part of the namespace for purposes of uniqueness. 

As an example, the following is a valid RIPP trunk URI:

"https\://ripp.comcast.com/trunks/6ha937fjjj9"

This URI MUST be returned in the OAuth2.0 parameter "ripp-trunk", and
MUST be base64 encoded.

The RIPP consumer MUST follow the procedures defined in [@RFC6749] for
an OAuth client, trade in its authorization code for both a refresh
and access token. The RIPP provider MUST issue both refresh and access
tokens. It is expected that the refresh token will last a long time,
in order to avoid the resource owner needing to manually
re-authorize. The trunk consumer MUST be prepared for its access and
refresh tokens to be invalidated at any time. The RIPP consumer MUST
extract the "ripp-trunk" OAuth parameter from the authorization
response, decode, and persist it.

Once the RIPP consumer has obtained an access token, it MUST initiate
an HTTPS PUT request towards /consumerTrunk on the provider trunk URI. This request MUST contain
an Authorization header field utilizing the access token just
obtained. It MUST include a RIPP provisioning object in the body. This
object is specified in Section (#syntax).

The RIPP provisioning object MUST contain a RIPP trunk consumer URI and
a RIPP bearer token. The RIPP consumer MUST mint an HTTPS URI for the
RIPP Trunk consumer URI. This URI MUST support HTTP/3, and MUST implement
the behaviours associated with capabilities and new call operations as
defined below. This URI MUST have a path component,  MUST NOT
contain any URI parameters, and MUST have a path segment which is
globally unique.

In addition, the RIPP consumer MUST mint a bearer token to be used by
the RIPP provider when performing operations against the RIPP Trunk
Client URI. The bearer token MAY be constructed in any way desired by
the RIPP consumer. The token and URI SHOULD remain valid for at least
one day, however, a security problem could cause them to be invalidated.
The RIPP consumer MUST refresh the provisioning against the
RIPP trunk at least one hour in advance of the expiration, in order to
ensure no calls are delayed.

At this point, the RIPP trunk is provisioned. Both the RIPP provider
and RIPP consumer have a RIPP trunk URI and an Authorization token to
be used for placing calls in each direction.

## Capabilities

Once provisioned, each side obtains receive capabilities about the
trunk from its peer. To do that, each client performs an HTTP GET
to /capAdv on its peer's RIPP trunk URI. The response body MUST be a
RIPP capabilities object as defined in Section (#syntax).

Once established, either side MAY update the capabilities by sending
an HTTP push to trigger its peer to fetch a fresh capability
document. Due to race conditions, it is possible that the client
may receive calls compliant to the old capabilities document for a
brief interval. It MUST be prepared for this.

When the trunk resource is destroyed, its associated capabilities are
also destroyed.

The capabilities are descriebd by an Advertisement 

Capabilities are bound to the RIPP trunk, and are
destroyed when the RIPP trunk is destroyed.

In general, an entity MUST declare a capability for any characteristic
of a call which may result in the call being rejected. This
requirement facilitates prevention of call failures, along with clear
indications of why calls have failed when they do. For example, if a
RIPP trunk provider provisions a trunk without support for G.729, but
the consumer configures their to utilize this codec, this will be
known as a misconfiguration immediately. This enables validation of
trunk configurations in an automated fashion, without placing test
calls or calling customer support.

## Advertisement

[[ CJ - Propose we move this section and next to a separate draft ]]

The RIPP advertisement  is a list of media sources and sinks along with
the codecs they suppor and a set of name-value pairs, which
specify a capability of the codec on that source or sink.

A device with a single microphone and speaker that support G.711 and
opus might have an advertisement that looked like:

~~~ ascii-art
mic1: opus,PCMU,PCMA
spk1: opus,PCUM,PCMA
~~~

A device with a camera that could support H.264 at 4K and av1 at 1080p
might have a advertisement that looked like:

~~~ ascii-art
cam1: H264 @size=1920x1080
cam1: av1 @size=3840x2160
~~~

The syntax is a names  for the source or sink, followed by a
comma separated list of supported codecs, followed by at @ sign then
a comma separated set of limits. The name for a source or sink can
occur multiple times with each line indicating a different codec and
limits.

Sources that are only send audio have a name starting with mic while
video start with cam.  Sinks that receive only audio have a name
starting with spk and video sinks start with dis. Device that sources
and sink audio start with aud while ones that source and sink video
start with vid. If a device and source and sink audo and video is can
start with av.

An video phone that could support opus and H.264 at 720p @ 30 fps might look
like:

~~~ ascii-art
av1: H264,opus @size=1280x720,fps=30
~~~

Every capability has a default, so that if no
document is posted, or it is posted but a specific capability is not
included, the capability for the peer is understood.

This specification defines the following capability set for audio codecs. 

* sr: The maximum sample rate for audio. This is specified in Hz. The
  default is 48000.

* ss: The maximum sample size for audio. This is specified
  in bits. It MUST be greater than or equal to 8. The default is 16. 

* cbr: If present, indicates whether the entity requires constant
  bitrate (CBR) media only. Default is not constant bit rate.

* ch: Indicates whether the entity supports  multiple
  audio channels.  The default is 1.

* ptime: max duration of media encoded in single packet in ms. Default is 30. 

This specification defines the following capability set for video
codecs:

* fps: The maximum frame rate for video. This is specified in frames per
  second. The default is 30.

* size: the max width in pixels followed by and x then the max height
  in pixels. Default is TBD.

* pr: the max pixel rate ( pixels / second ). Default is 2^64-1. 

* depth: the max pixel depth in bits. Default is 8.

This specification defines the following capability set for scalable video
codecs:

* tlay: max number of temporal layers. Each sub layer runs at twice the
rate of the later it depends on. Default is 1.

* slay: max numer of spacial layers. Each sub layer has 2 times the number
  of pixel of layer it depended on. Default
  is 1. [[ Open issue 2 times or 4 times ]] 

This specification defines the following capability set for both audio
and video codecs.

* br: The maximum bitrate in kilo bits per second for receiving audio or
  video. This is specified in bits per second. This is the rate of
  encoded media from the codec and not the rate transmitted over the
  network. Default is 2^64-1.

* tnt: If present Indicates whether the entity supports the
  takeback-and-transfer (TNT) command. The default is does not support
  TNT.

A PSTN gateway that supported G.711 and TNT might have an advertisement
that looked like:

~~~ ascii-art
aud1:PCMU,PCMA@tnt
~~~

This capabilities are extensible through an IANA registry. [[ TODO ]] 

The codec names are defined in the IANA registry "Media Types" at
https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml


## Proposal

[[ CJ - Propose we move this section and previous to a separate draft ]]

The proposal uses the same syntax as the advertisement and is used to
configure what media sources send. The proposal can be full accepted or
rejected by the media source that is being configured with proposal but
partial acceptance is not allowed.

For example, a controller could configure a camera to with the following
proposal:

~~~ ascii-art
cam1: H264@size=1280x720,fps=30
mic1: opus@br=20
~~~

This would tell the camera to send video at resolutions and frame rates up
to 720p at 30fps. The camera might send less than this due to congestion
of other reasons but it would not exceed this. It would send  audio
using opus but encoded not to exceed a bandwith of 20 kbps.

The source and sink names must match the names in the advertisement from
this device. 

## Initiating Calls

HTTP connections are completely independent of RIPP trunks or
calls. As such, RIPP clients SHOULD reuse existing HTTP connections
for any request targeted at the same authority to which an existing
HTTP connection is open. RIPP clients SHOULD also utilize 0-RTT HTTP
procedures in order to speed up call setup times. 

To initiate a new call, a RIPP client creates an HTTPS POST request to
/calls endpoint on the RIPP trunk URI of its peer. For a trunking
consumer, this is the 
RIPP trunk URI provisioned during the OAuth2.0 flow. For the trunking
provider, it is the RIPP trunk consumer URI learned through the
provisioning POST operation. This MUST be an HTTP/3 transaction. The
client MUST validate that the TLS certificate that is returned matches
the authority component of the RIPP trunk URI. 

This request MUST contain the token that the client has
obtained out-of-band. For the RIPP trunk consumer, this is the OAuth
token. For the RIPP trunk provider, it is the bearer token learned
through the provisioning POST operation.

The client MUST also add the "target" URI parameter. This parameter
MUST be of the form user@domain. If the target is a phone number on
the PSTN, this must take the form <e164>@e164.arpa, where <e164> is a
valid E.164 number. RIPP also supports private trunks, in which case
the it MUST take the form <number>@<domain>, where the number is a
non-E164 number scoped to be valid within the domain. This form MUST
NOT be used for E.164 numbers. Finally, RIPP can be used to place call
to application services - such as a recorder - in which case the
parameter would take the form of an RFC822 email address.

The client MUST add an HTTP Identity header field. This header field
is defined in Section (#iana) as a new HTTP header field. Its contents MUST
be a valid Identity header field as defined by [@RFC8224]. This
ensures that all calls utilize secure caller ID. A RIPP client MUST
NOT place the caller ID in any place except for the Identity header
field in this request. Specifically, a "From", "Contact", or
"P-Asserted-ID" header field MUST NOT ever appear.

* CJ - I would prefer to add this another way without using a header. 

The server MUST validate the OAuth token, MUST act as the verifying
party to verify the Identity header field, and then authorize the
creation of a new call, and then either accept or reject the
request. If accepted, it indicates that the server is willing to
create this call. The server MUST return a 201 Created response, and
MUST include a Location header field containing an HTTPS URI which
identifies the call that has been created. The URI identifying the
call MUST include a path segment which contains a type 4 UUID,
ensuring that call identifiers are globally unique.

The server MAY include HTTP session cookies in the 201 response. The
client MUST support receipt of cookies [@RFC6265]. It MUST be prepared
to receive up to 10 cookies per call. The client MUST destroy all
cookies associated with a call, when the call has ended. Cookies MUST
NOT be larger the 5K.

The usage of an HTTP URI to identify the call itself, combined with
session cookies, gives the terminating RIPP domain a great deal of
flexibility in how it manages state for the call. In traditional
softswitch designs, call and media state is held in-memory in the
server and not placed into databases. In such a design, a RIPP server
can use the session cookie in combination with sticky session routing
in the load balancers to ensure that subsequent requests for the same
call go to the same call server. Alternatively, if the server is not
using any kind of HTTP load balancer at all, it can use a specific
hostname in the URI to route all requests for this call to a specific
instance of the server. This technique is particularly useful for
telcos who have not deployed HTTP infrastructure, but do have SBCs
that sit behind a single virtual IP address. The root URI can use a domain whose A
record maps to this IP. Once a call has landed on
a particular SBC, the call URI can indicate the specific IP of
the SBC.

For example, the RIPP trunk URI for such a telco operator might be:

"https\://sbc-farm.comcast.com/trunks/6ha937fjjj9"

which always resolves to 1.2.3.4, the VIP shared amongst the SBC
farm. Consequently, a request to this RIPP trunk would hit a specific
SBC behind the VIP. This SBC would then create the call and return a
call URL which points to its actual IP, using DNS

"https\://sbc23.sbc-farm.comcast.com/call/ha8d7f6fso29s88clzopa"

However, the HTTP URI for the call MUST NOT contain an IP address; it
MUST utilize a valid host or domain name. This is to ensure that TLS
certificate validation functions properly without manual
configuration of certificates (a practice which is required still for
SIP based peering).

Neither the request, nor the response, contain bodies.


## Establishing the Signaling Byways

To perform signalling for this call, the client MUST
initiate an HTTP GET and PUT request towards the call URI that it
just obtained, targeted at the /event endpoint. 

The signaling is accomplished by a long running HTTP transaction, with
a stream of JSON in the PUT request, and a stream of JSON in the GET
response.

The body begins with an open square bracket to indicate the start of an
JSON array, and after that is a
series of JSON objects, each starting with a curly bracket, and ending
with a curly bracket. Consequently, each side MUST immediately send
their respective open square brackets after the HTTP header fields. We
utilize streaming JSON in order to facilitate usage of tools like CURL
for signalling operations. 

## The Media Sequence

In RIPP, media is represented as a continuous sequence of RIPP media
frames embedded in a media byway. Each ripp media frame encodes a variable
length sequence number offset, followed by a variable length length
field, followed by a codec frame equal to that length. The media byway
itself, when created, includes properties that are shared across all
media frames within that byway. These parameters include the sequence
number base, the timestamp base, the codec type, and the frame size in
milliseconds for the codec.

This is a significantly different design than RTP, which conveys many
repeated parameters (such as the payload type and timestamp) in every
packet. Instead, RIPP extracts information that will be shared across
many packets and associates it with the byway itself. This means the
media frames only contain the information which varies - the sequence
number and length. [[OPEN ISSUE: we could maybe even eliminate the
sequence number by computing it from offset in the stream. Worried
about sync problems though?]]

Consequently, each media frame has the following properties:

* The sequence number, which is equal to the sequence number base
  associated with the media byway, PLUS the value of the sequence
  number offset

* The timestamp, which is equal to the timestamp base from the byway,
  PLUS the sequence number offset TIMES the frame size in
  milliseconds. Note that this requires that frame size must remain
  fixed for all media frames in a byway.

* The codec type, which is a fixed property of the byway. There are no
  payload type numbers in RIPP.

RIPP does not support gaps in the media sequence due to
silence. Something must be transmitted for each time interval. If a
RIPP implementation wishes to change codecs, it MUST utilize a
different byway for that codec. 

## Opening Media Byways

The client bears the responsibility for opening media byways - both
forward and reverse. Consequently, the server is strongly dependent on the
client opening reverse  byways; it cannot send media unless they've been
opened.

A client MUST open a new forward byway whenever it has a media frame to send,
all existing forward byways (if any) are in the blocked state, and the client
has not yet opened 20 byways.

Furthermore, the client MUST keep a minimum of 10 reverse byways open
at all times. This ensures the server can send media. The client MUST
open these byways immediately, in parallel. 

The use of multiple media byways in either direction is essential to
low latency operation of RIPP. This is because, as describe below,
media frames are sprayed across these byways in order to ensure that
there is never head-of-line blocking. This is possible because, in
HTTP/3, each transaction is carried over a separate QUIC stream, and
QUIC streams run on top of UDP. Furthermore, a QUIC stream does not
require a handshake to be established - creation of new QUIC streams
is a 0-RTT process.

The requests to create these transactions MUST include Cookie headers for any
applicable session cookies.

To open a forward media byway, the client MUST initiate a POST request
to the /media-forward endpoint on the call URI, and MUST include a RIPP-Media header field in the request
headers. Similarly, to open a reverse media byway, the client MUST
initiate a POST request to the /media-reverse endpoint of the call
URI. It MUST NOT include a RIPP-Media header field
in the request headers. The server MUST include the RIPP-Media header
in the response headers. The RIPP-Media header contains the properties for the
byway - the sequence number base, the timestamp base, and the name of
the codec.

RIPP supports multiple audio channels, meant for SIPREC use cases.  Each
channel MUST be on a separate byway. When multi-channel audio is being
used, the client MUST include the multi-channel parameter and MUST
include the channel number, starting at 1.

All RIPP implementations MUST support G.711 and Opus audio codecs. All
implementations MUST support [@RFC2833] for DTMF, and MUST support
[@RFC3389] for comfort noise, for both sending and receiving.

The sequence number space is unique for each direction, channel, and
call (as identified by the call URI). Each side MUST start the
sequence number at zero, and MUST increment it by one for each
subsequent media frame. The sequence number base is represented as a
string corresponding to a 32 bit unsigned integer, and the sequence
number offset in the media frame is variable length, representing an
unsigned integer. Consequently, the sequence number space for a media
stream within a call has a total space of 32 bits. With a minimum
frame size of 10ms, RIPP can support call 
durations as long as 11,930 hours. Rollover of the sequence number is
not permitted, the client or server MUST end the call before
rollover. This means that the combination of call URI, direction
(client to server, or server to client), channel number, and sequence
number represent a unique identifier for media
packets.

## Sending and Receiving Media

The approach for media is media striping. 

To avoid HOL blocking, we cannot send a second media packet on a byway
until we are sure the prior media packet was received. This is why the
client opens multiple media byways.

When either the client or server sends a media frame on a byway, it
immediately marks the byway as blocked. At that point, it SHOULD NOT
send another media frame on that byway. The client or server notes the
sequence number and channel number for that media frame. Once it
receives an acknowledgement for that
corresponding media frame, it marks the byway as UNBLOCKED. A client
or server MAY send a media frame on any unblocked byway.

The sequence number for the media frame is computed based on the rules
described above. 

Per the logic described above, the client will open additional byways
once the number of blocked byways goes above a threshold. If a the
number of blocked byways in either direction hits 75% of the total for
that direction, this is a signal that congestion has occurred. In such
a case, the client or server MUST either drop packets at the
application layer, or buffer them for later transmission. [[TODO: can
we play with QUIC priorities to prioritize newer media frames over
older?]]

When a client or server receives a media frame, it MUST send an
acknowledge message. This message MUST be sent on the same byway on
which the media was received. This acknowledgement
message MUST contain the full sequence number and channel number for
the media packet that was received. It MUST also contain the
timestamp, represented as wallclock time, at which the media packet was
received.

If the server has marked 75% of the reverse media byways
as blocked, it MUST send a signaling event
instructing the client to open another reverse media byway. Once this command
is received, the client MUST open a new reverse byway, unless the total number
of byways has reached 20. 

A client MAY terminate media byways gracefully if they have not
sent or received packets on that byway for 5 or more
seconds. This is to clean up unused byways.

There is no need for sender or receiver reports. The equivalent
information is knowable from the application layer acknowledgements.


## Terminating and Re-establishing Connections and  Byways

The state of the connection, the QUIC streams, and byways, is separate
from the state of the call. The client MAY terminate an HTTP
connection or byway at any time, and re-establish it. Similarly, the
server or client may end the a byway at any time.

If a byway ends or the connection breaks or is migrated, the client
MUST re-initiate the byways immediately, or risk loss of media
and signalling events. However, to deal with the fact that
re-establishment takes time, both client and server MUST buffer their
signalling and media streams for at least 5 seconds, and then once the
connections and byways are re-established, it sends all buffered data
immediately.

Note that it is the sole responsibility of the client to make sure
byways are re-established if they fail unexpectedly. 


## Signaling - Events

Signaling is performed by having the client and server exchange
events. Each event is a JSON object embedded in the signalling
stream, which conveys the event as perceived by the client or
server. Each event has a sequence number, which starts at zero for a
call, and increases by one for each event. The sequence number space
is unique in each direction. The event also contains a direction
field, which indicates whether the event was sent from client to
server, or server to client. It also contains a timestamp field, which
indicates the time of the event as perceived by the sender. This
timestamp is not updated when retransmissions happen; the timestamp
exists at the RIPP application layer and RIPP cannot directly observe
HTTP retransmits.

It also contains a call field, which contains the URI of the call in
question. 

Finally, there is an event type field, which conveys the type of
event. This is followed by additional fields which are specific to the
event type.

This structure means that each event carried in the signalling is
totally self-describing, irregardless of the enclosing connection and
stream. This greatly facilitates logging, debugging, retransmissions,
retries, and other race conditions which may deliver the same event
multiple times, or deliver an event to a server which is not aware of
the call.

Events are also defined so that the resulting state is uniquely
defined by the event itself. This ensures that knowing the most recent
event is sufficient to determine the state of the call. 

This specification defines the following events:

alerting: Passed from server to client, indicating that the recipient
is alerting.

accepted: Passed from server to client, indicating that the call was
accepted.

rejected: Passed from server to client, indicating that the call was
rejected by the user.

failed: Passed from server to client, indicating that the call was
rejected by server or downstream servers, not by the user, but due to
some kind of error condition. This event contains a response code and
reason phrase, which are identical to the response codes and reason
phrases in SIP.

noanswer: Passed from server to client, indicating that the call was
delivered to the receiving user but was not answered, and the server
or a downstream server timed out the call.

end: initiated by either client or server, it indicates that the call
is to be terminated. Note that this does NOT delete the HTTP resource,
it merely changes its state to call end. Furthermore, a call cannot be
ended with a DELETE against the call URI; DELETE is not permitted and
MUST be rejected by the server. The call end event SHOULD contain a
reason, using the Reason codes defined for SIP.

* CJ - Not keen on SIP reason codes - they did not conatin enough info
  for all the Q950 stuff and were not particually extensible. I think it
  would be better to define a set here with clear mapping to SIP and SIP
  +Q950 reasons. 

migrate: sent from server to client, it instructs the client to
terminate the connections and re-establish them to a new URI which
replaces the URI for the call. The event contains the new URI to
use. This new URI MUST utilize the same path components, and MUST have
a different authority component.

open-reverse: sent from server to client, it instructs the client to
open an additional set of reverse media byways.

* CJ - would it work to have this all far simplier and just have the
  trunk cap advertisemtn say how many to open up ? 

tnt: send from consumer to provider, it invokes a
takeback-and-transfer operation. It includes the phone number to which
the call should be transferred. The provide will then transfer the
call to the target number. This event is meant to invoke the feature
as it has been implemented by the provider. RIPP does not define
additional behaviors.

## Call Termination

Signaling allows an application layer call end to be sent. This will
also cause each side to terminate the the outstanding transactions
using end flags per HTTP/3 specs. However, the opposite is not true -
ending of the transactions or connection does not impact the call
state.

A server MUST maintain a timer, with a value equal to one second, for
which it will hold the call in its current state without any active
signalling byway. If the server does not receive a signalling
byway before the expiration of this timer, it MUST consider the
call as ended. Once the call has ended, the call resource SHOULD be destroyed. 

If the server receives a signalling or media byway for a call that
is TERMINATED, it MUST reject the transaction with an 404
response code, since the resource no longer exists.



## GET Transactions

A client MAY initiate a GET request against the call URI at any
time. This returns the current state of the resource. This request
returns the most recent event, either sent
by the server or received by the server.

* CJ - lets call this previosEvent as the event part waits till the
  next event on a long poll. Be good to say something about how this is
  used as it is not clear to me it is needed. 

## Graceful Call Migration: Server

To facilitate operational maintenance, the protocol has built in
support for allowing a server instance to drain all active calls to
another server instance.

The server can issue a migrate event over the signalling byway,
which includes a new call URI that the peer should use. Once received,
the client closes all transactions to the current call URI. It then
establishes new signalling, media and media control byways to the URI
it just received. All media that the client wishes to transmit, but
was unable to do so during the migration, is buffered and then sent in
a burst once the media byways are re-established. This ensures there
is no packet loss (though there will be jitter) during the migration
period. 

We don't use QUIC layer connection migration, as that is triggered by
network changes and not likely to be exposed to applications.

## Graceful Call Migration: Client

Clients can move a call from one client instance to another easily. No
commands are required. The client simply ends the in-progress
transactions for signalling and media, and then reinitiates them to the
existing call URI from whatever server is to take over. Note that the
client MUST do this within 1s or the server will end the call. 

## Ungraceful Call Migration

Since all media packets are acknowledged at the application layer, it
is possible for endpoints to very quickly detect remote failures,
network failures, and other related problems.

Failure detection falls entirely at the hands of the client. A failure
situation is detected when any one of the following happens:

1. The QUIC connection closes unexpectedly
2. Any outstanding signalling or media byway is reset by the
peer
3. No media packets are received from the peer for 1s
4. No acknowledgements are received for packets that have been sent in
the last 1s

If the client detects such a failure, it MUST abort all ongoing
transactions to the server, terminate the QUIC connection, and then
establish a new connection using 0-RTT, and re-establish signalling
and media transactions. If this retry fails, the client MUST consider
the call terminated. It SHOULD NOT a further attempt to re-establish
the call.

* CJ - Note there is no way to know if it can use 0-RTT or not, all
  depends on cached state so the best it can do is hope it might work. 




# SIP Gateway 

RIPP is designed to be easy to gateway from SIP. The expectation is
that RIPP will be implemented in SBCs and softswitches. A SIP to RIPP
gateway has to be call-stateful, acting as a B2BUA, in order to
gateway to RIPP. Furthermore, a SIP to RIPP gateway has to act as a
media termination point in SIP. It has to perform any SRTP decryption
and encryption, and it must de-packetize RTP packets to extract their
timestamps, sequence numbers, and codec types.

SIP to RIPP gateways are not transparent. SIP header fields which are
unknown or do not map to RIPP functionality as described here, MUST be
discarded.

Any configuration and provisioning for RIPP happens ahead of receipt
or transmission of SIP calls. Consequently, the logic described here
applies at the point that a gateway receives a SIP INVITE on the SIP
side, or receives a POST to the RIPP trunk URI on the RIPP side.

This specification does define some normative procedures for the
gateway function in order to maximize interoperability.
