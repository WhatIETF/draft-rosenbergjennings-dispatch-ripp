<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> <a href="#background" id="background">Background</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">Cloud computing platforms, such as those provided by Amazon, Azure, and Google, have now become mainstream for the development of software applications. These platforms are targeted at enabling web applications, and as such many of their features are based on the usage of HTTP.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">One example are HTTP load balancers. Cloud computing platforms provide highly scalable, geographically distributed, redundant load balancers. These load balancers can monitor the state of downstream servers and can uniformly distribute load amongst them. The load balancers can compensate for failure of individual nodes and send new traffic to other nodes.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3">Autoscaling is another example. The cloud computing platforms can automatically add new instances of a server backend, or remove them, and automatically configure the load balancers to include them in the pool of available servers.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4">Yet another example is Kubernetes, which allows web-based applications to be deployed into containers (typically Docker), with load balancing, scaling, and HTTP request routing.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.5">Another example are HTTP tracing tools, which facilitate the tracing of requests through distributed microservices. These tools can autogenerate sequence diagrams and facilitate in troubleshooting.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.6">Yet another example are API gateways (such as APIGee and Kong), which provide authentication and authorization, provisioning of applications, rate limiting, analytics, sandboxing for testing, embedded documentation, and so on.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.7">And yet another example are denial-of-service prevention techniques, typically done using BGP peering and re-routing. Though in principle these techniques can work for VoIP, they are deployed in conjunction with the load balancers which represent the entry point into these cloud provider networks. Consequently, the protections these cloud providers offer do not extend to applications which merely use these platforms for virtual machines.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.8">A more recent technology are service meshes, such as Istio, which utilize sidecar HTTP proxies to facilitate inter-service communications. These systems come with robust control planes which enable additional routing features, such as canary deploys, percentage based routing, and so on.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.2">1.2.</a> <a href="#problem-statement" id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">Unfortunately, there are many applications being deployed into these cloud platforms which require interconnection with other administrative domains providing real-time voice and video services. One example is interconnection with the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Examples of such applications include cloud PBXs, cloud contact centers, cloud meetings applications, and so on. Furthermore, commerce websites would like to allow customers to call into the telephone network for customer support.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.2">In order for these applications to connect to the PSTN, or to connect voice and video services in other domains, they typically deploy Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <a href="#RFC3261" class="xref">[RFC3261]</a> based servers - SBCs, SIP proxies, and softswitches, to provide this interconnection. Unfortunately, SIP based applications cannot make use of the many capabilities these cloud platforms afford to HTTP based applications. These SIP servers are usually deployed on bare metal or VMs at best. Application developers must build their own load balancing, HA, failover, clustering, security, and scaling technologies, rather than using the capabilities of these platforms.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.3">Another problem has been call drops. SIP's original design where call state lived only in the endpoints and media was sent p2p - provided extremely high reliability. In practice, SIP networks are full of state that resides in server intermediaries (softswitches, SBCs, and so on), and has seen media transmitted through these intermediaries. Unfortunately, the SIP protocol did not provide built-in mechanisms which enable call preservation - the ability of a call to survive failure of any server component without call drops. As a result, many of these servers rely on layer 3 solutions (such as shared VIPs with proprietary state replication), which are expensive, hard to deploy, and of limited scale. In other cases, they are absent, in which case a server failure will cause all calls to be dropped, requiring the end user themselves to re-initiate the call.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.4">The statefulness of most server components has also meant that software upgrade is a manual process. To avoid dropped calls, it must be performed late at night, causing a risk of downtime. Other implementations have waited for calls to drain, and then performed automated restarts. This almost always requires a timeout (typically an hour or more) at which point calls longer than that get dropped. The result is that rolling software upgrades have caused some amount of call drops, and can take an extremely long time to propagate through a cluster. This was acceptable perhaps in the era of traditional client-server applications where software upgrades were infrequent. Modern software systems perform updates many times a day, which is incompatible with SIP-based systems.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.5">All of this has created a barrier to entry, particularly for applications such as websites which are not expert in VoIP technologies. Furthermore, it has meant that VoIP applications have been unable to take advantage of the many technology improvements that have come to networking and protocol design since the publication of RFC 3261 in 2002.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.6">In addition, SIP trunking has suffered from complex provisioning operations, oftentimes requiring the exchange of static IPs and ports. These operations are almost never self-service and consequently, SIP trunk turn ups can take weeks.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.7">Finally, perhaps the biggest challenge with SIP trunking has been its abuse for injecting robocalls, and in general weak deployment of security.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.8">In summary - there are four core problems which this specification is addressing in the traditional usage of SIP peering between entities: </p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>The difficulty of deploying real-time communications servers into web-centric cloud platforms, which can enable modern solutions for load balancing, infinite scale, autoscaling, hitless software upgrade, and so on.</li>
<li>Lack of built-in protocol mechanisms for call preservation, scaling, software upgrade, and so on.</li>
<li>Lack of standardized and automated techniques for provisioning and configuration of SIP trunks</li>
<li>Lack of secure caller ID</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.3">1.3.</a> <a href="#core-concept" id="core-concept">Core Concept</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.1">The core concept of RIPP is simple - to make voice and video peering yet another application that sits on top of HTTP.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.2">Though SIP was inspired by HTTP, it is not HTTP itself. SIP and HTTP are peers - application protocols running ontop of the Internet. In the intervening years, HTTP evolved to become a general purpose substrate for delivering Internet applications. It is fair to say that today, almost all applications users consume over the Internet run over HTTP (with obvious exception of inter-server email - much client to server email is also now run over HTTP).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.3">This resulted - in essence - a rift between telecommunications technologies and web technologies. Both had their own protocol stacks, their own sets of products and services, and so on.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.4">RIPP is an attempt to seal this rift by reunifying web and telecommunications technologies, with web as the "winner".  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.5">The idea of re-converging HTTP and SIP is certainly not new, and indeed has been discussed in the hallways of IETF for many years. However, several significant limitations made this previously infeasible: </p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>HTTP utilized TCP, which meant that it created head-of-line blocking which would delay lost packets rather than just discard them. This will often provide intolerable latency for VoIP.</li>
<li>HTTP was request response, allowing the client to send requests and receive a response. There as no way for a server to asynchronously send information to the client in an easy fashion.</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.7">HTTP2 <a href="#RFC7540" class="xref">[RFC7540]</a> addressed the second of these with the introduction of pushes and long running requests. However, its usage of TCP was still a problem. This has finally been addressed with the arrival of QUIC <a href="#I-D.ietf-quic-transport" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-quic-transport]</a> and HTTP/3. QUIC is based on UDP, and it introduces the concept of a stream that can be set up with zero RTT. These streams are carried over UDP, and though are still reliable, there is no head of line blocking across streams. This change has made it possible for HTTP to support real-time applications.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.8">This specification makes an assumption that <a href="#I-D.ietf-quic-transport" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-quic-transport]</a> will be widely implemented and deployed as a mainstream part of web-based software systems, but any extensions unique to the needs of VoIP will struggle to see widespread deployment.  As a result, RIPP uses HTTP/3 <a href="#I-D.ietf-quic-http" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-quic-http]</a>, but is not an extension to it. This means that RIPP inherits the benefits of classic HTTP deployments - easy load balancing, easy expansion and contraction of clusters (including auto-scaling), standard techniques for encryption, authentication, and denial-of-service prevention, and so on.  </p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#design" id="design">Design Approaches</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">To meet the requirements stated above, RIPP makes several fundamental changes compared to SIP. These changes, and their motivations, are described in the sections below.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.1">4.1.</a> <a href="#clientserver-not-multielement" id="clientserver-not-multielement">Client-Server, not Multi-Element</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">SIP was designed as a complete system architecture. As such, it explicitly incorporates features which presume the existence of a network of elements - proxies and registrars in particular. SIP provides many features to facilitate this - Via headers, record-routing, and so on.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">HTTP on the other hand - is strictly a client-to-server technology. Though it does support the notion of proxies (ala the CONNECT method for reverse proxies), the protocol is fundamentally designed to be between a client and an authoritative server. What happens beyond that authoritative server is beyond the scope of HTTP, and can (and often does) include additional HTTP transactions.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">Consequently, in order to reside within HTTP, RIPP follows the same pattern and only concerns itself with client-server behaviours. Like HTTP, a RIPP server can of course act as a RIPP client and further connect calls to downstream elements. However, such behavior requires no additional specification and is therefore not discussed by RIPP.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2">4.2.</a> <a href="#clientserver-not-agenttoagent" id="clientserver-not-agenttoagent">Client-Server, not Agent-to-Agent</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">SIP is based fundamentally on the User Agent, and describes the communications between a pair of user agents. Either user agent can initiate requests towards the other. SIP defines the traditional role of client and server as bound to a specific transaction.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">HTTP does not operate this way. In HTTP, one entity is a client, and the other is a server. There is no way for the server to send messages asynchronously towards the client. HTTP/3 does enable two distinct techniques that facilitate server messaging towards the client. But to use them, RIPP must abide by HTTP/3 rules, and that means distinct roles for clients and servers. Clients must always initiate connections and send requests, not servers.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">To handle this, RIPP specifies that the domain associated with the caller implements the RIPP client, and the domain receiving the calls is the RIPP server. For any particular call, the roles of client and server do not change. To facilitate calls in either direction, a domain can implement both RIPP client and RIPP server roles. However, there is no relationship between the two directions.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.3">4.3.</a> <a href="#signaling-and-media-together" id="signaling-and-media-together">Signaling and Media Together</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.1">One of the most fundamental design properties of SIP was the separation of signalling and media. This was fundamental to the success of SIP, since it enabled high quality, low latency media between endpoints inside of an enterprise or consumer domain.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">This design technique is quite hard to translate to HTTP, especially when considering load balancing and scaling techniques. HTTP load balancing is effective because it treats each request/response pair as an independent action which can route to any number of backends. In essence, the request/response transaction is atomic, and consequentially RIPP needs to operate this way as well.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.3">Though SIP envisioned that signalling and media separation would also apply to inter-domain calls, in practice this has not happened. Inter-domain interconnect - including interconnection with the PSTN - is done traditionally with SBCs which terminate and re-originate media. Since this specification is targeted at inter-domain peering cases, RIPP fundamentally combines signalling and media together on the same connection. To ensure low latency, it uses multiple independent request/response transactions - each running in parallel over unique HTTP transactions (and thus unique QUIC streams) - to transmit media.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.4">4.4.</a> <a href="#uris-not-ips" id="uris-not-ips">URIs not IPs</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.1">SIP is full of IP addresses and ports. They are contained in Via headers, in Route and Record-Route headers. In SDP. In Contact headers. The usage of IPs is one of the main reasons why SIP is so difficult to deploy into cloud platforms. These platforms are based on the behavior of HTTP which has been based on TCP connections and therefore done most of its routing at the connection layer, and not the IP layer.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.2">Furthermore, modern cloud platforms are full of NATs and private IP space, making them inhospitable to SIP based applications which still struggle with NAT traversal.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.3">HTTP of course does not suffer from this. In general, "addressing", to the degree it exists at all, is done with HTTP URIs. RIPP follows this pattern. RIPP - as a web application that uses HTTP/3 - does not use or convey any IP addresses or ports. Furthermore, the client never provides addressing to the server - all traffic is sent in the reverse direction over the connection.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.5">4.5.</a> <a href="#oauth-not-mtls-or-private-ip" id="oauth-not-mtls-or-private-ip">OAuth not MTLS or private IP</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.1">When used in peering arrangements today, authentication for the SIP connections is typically done using mutual TLS. It is also often the case that security is done at the IP layer, and sometimes even via dedicated MPLS connections which require pre-provisioning. Unfortunately, these techniques are quite incompatible with how modern cloud platforms work.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.2">HTTP - due to its client-server nature, uses asymmetric techniques for authentication. Most notably, certificate based authentication is done by the client to verify that it is speaking to the server it thinks it should be speaking to. For the server to identify the client, modern platforms make use of OAuth2.0. Though OAuth is not actually an authentication protocol, the use of OAuth has allowed authentication to be done out of band via separate identity servers which produce OAuth tokens which can then be used for authentication of the client.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.3">Consequently, RIPP follows this same approach. The client initiates calls towards the server. The server uses TLS to provide its identity to the client, and the client provides a token to the server to identify itself, with a login technique occuring elsewhere. To facilitate bidirectional calls, an entity would just implement both the server and client roles. For any one call, the entity placing the call acts as the client, and the one receiving it, as the server. To handle the common case where there is an asymmetric business relationship (one entity being a customer of the other), RIPP facilitates a simple provisioning process by which the customer can use an OAuth token to provision credentials for usage in the reverse direction.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.4">This specification also envisions a simple extension which would allow single-device clients to receive inbound calls from the server - however, such an extension is outside the scope of this document.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.6">4.6.</a> <a href="#tls-not-srtp-or-sips" id="tls-not-srtp-or-sips">TLS not SRTP or SIPS</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.1">SIP has provided encryption of both signalling and media, through the usage of SIP over TLS and SIPS, and SRTP, respectively. Unfortunately, these have not been widely deployed. The E2E nature of SRTP has made keying an ongoing challenge, with multiple technologies developed over the years. SIP itself has seen greater uptake of TLS transport, but this remains uncommon largely due to the commonality of private IP peering as an alternative.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.2">Because of the HBH nature of RIPP, security is done fundamentally at the connection level - identically to HTTP. Since media is also carrier over the HTTP connection, both signalling and media are covered by the connection security provided by HTTP/3.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.3">Because of the mandatory usage of TLS1.3 with HTTP/3, and the expected widespread deployment of HTTP/3, running VoIP on top of HTTP/3 will bring built-in encryption of media and signalling between peering domains, which is a notable improvement over the current deployment situation. It is also necessary in order to utilize HTTP/3.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.4">For reasons of interoperability, and to enable e2e media encryption in several inter-domain use cases, RIPP assumes each media chunk may be encrypted, and if so, it contains a key ID which dereferences the encryption keys, ciphers and other information needed to decrypt the packet. The exchange of these keys and ciphers is done entirely out of band of RIPP.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.5">However, RIPP does not support SRTP. If a client receives a SIP call with SRTP, it must terminate the SRTP and decrypt media before sending it over RIPP. This matches existing practice in many cases.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.7">4.7.</a> <a href="#authenticated-callerid" id="authenticated-callerid">Authenticated CallerID</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.7.p.1">Robocalling is seeing a dramatic rise in volume, and efforts to combat it continue. One of the causes of this problem is the ease of which SIP enables one domain to initiate calls to another domain without authenticated caller ID.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.7.p.2">With RIPP, we remedy this by requiring the client and servers to implement STIR. RIPP clients must either insert a signed passport, or pass one through. Similarly, RIPP servers must act as verifying parties and reject any calls that omit a passport. In cases where the RIPP client is an end device, it still inserts a passport - but uses a self-signed certificate.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.8.p.1">In SIP, there is a fuzzy relationship between calls and connections. In some cases, connection failures cause call terminations, and vice a versa.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.8.p.2">HTTP, on the other hand, very clearly separates the state of the resource being manipulated, with the state of the HTTP connection used to manipulate it. This design principle is inherited by RIPP. Consequently, call state on both client and server exist independently from the connections which manipulate them. This allows for greater availability my enabling connections for the same call to move between machines in the case of failures.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.9.p.1">HTTP/3 is designed to work through NAT as a client-server protocol. It has built in techniques for dealing with NAT re-bindings, IP address changes due to a client moving between networks (e.g., wifi to cellular data). It has built in path validation that ensures that HTTP cannot be used for amplification attacks.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.9.p.2">SIP has, over the years, solved these problems to some degree, but not efficiently nor completely. To work with HTTP, RIPP must utilize the HTTP approaches for these problems.

<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">This specification follows the terminology of HTTP/3, but adds the following concepts: </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">Terminal Group (TG): A container for calls between a client and server. A TG is identified by a URI, hosted on the server. A TG acts as a unit of policy and capabilities, including rules such as rate limits, allowed phone numbers, and so on. The acronym is a nod to its circuit switched predecessor, the Trunk Group.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.3">Call: A real-time voice and/or video session. A call is always associated with a TG, and is identified by a URI hosted on the server.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.4">Customer: An end user or administrative entity that utilizes communications services from a provider in order to make and receive calls. The relationship between the customer and provider is static and does not vary from call to call, and does not vary in call direction either. (e.g., Verizon would be the provider to an enterprise customer, and the enterprise would be the customer of Verizon). For the purposes of this specification, this matters in that a customer, if it wishes to implement the server role, will need to configure its provider with credentials and URI needed to enable the provider, acting as a client, to connect to its server. Consequently, RIPP provides a facility for this.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.5">Provider: The administrative entity that provides communications services to the customer.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.6">Byway: A bidirectional byte stream between a client and server. A byway passes its data through HTTP, using a set of techniques which depend on the capabilities of both sides and the use cases for which they are needed. This specification considers two types - a signaling byway and a media byway.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.7">Handler: A handler is a software or hardware entity, acting as a client, which sends and receives media associated with a call. The handler can change during a call (as in the case of a client failing and its calls being picked up by a backup). A handler has a description, which is relatively static, that describes its audio and video capabilities, device name, image, and so on.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.8">Directive: The directive is an instruction from the server, which tells a handler where it should send media to for this call.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">The customer and provider role is asymmetric. Typically the customer has purchased services from the provider. From a protocol perspective, RIPP assumes that the customer has an account with the provider, and it is possible for the customer to obtain an OAuth token which can be used to authenticate. However, there is no login technqiue which enables the provider to obtain a token to place calls towards the customer.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.3">Since calls always originate from client to server, in order to receive inbound calls, a customer can also run a RIPP server. RIPP supports a simple registration mecahnism by which the customer - acting as a client - can use RIPP to register its TG URI with the provider.  This registration also includes a bearer token for authorization.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.4">It is anticipated that an entity implementing the server role will use a load balancer to receive incoming requests to place calls. This is not required, of course. However, this specification provides no facility for a customer implementing only the client role to receive inbound calls. It is worth restating that this load balancer is NOT specific to RIPP - it is any off-the-shelf HTTP load balancer which supports HTTP/3. No specific support for RIPP is required. RIPP is just an application ontop of HTTP.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.5">Because RIPP clients and servers are nothing more than HTTP/3 applications, the behavior or RIPP is specified entirely by describing how various RIPP procedures map to the core HTTP/3 primitives available to applications - opening connections, closing connections, sending requests and responses, receiving requests and responses, and setting header fields and bodies. That's it.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> <a href="#domain-model" id="domain-model">Domain Model</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">The domain model for RIPP is based on the interplay between three key resources held by the server. These are the TG, the handler, and the call.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">The TG is a representation of the service offered by the server to the client. It indicates the allowed directions for calls (in this specification, outbound only), the allowed identities that can be used for caller ID, the allowed numbers which can be called, and a basic set of limits on call volumes. The purpose of the TG is to provide the client all of the information it needs to know, in advance, whether the placement of a call is within the allowed policy scope of the server.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">For example, a telco might offer an enterprise customer a service in which it can place calls to any number in the world, but it must use one of the 100 numbers that have been assigned to it as the caller ID. The TG object - literally a JSON document returned by the server - also called he representation of the TG - would provide this information to the client.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.4">In the case of a trunking use case where an enterprise customer is implementing the server and client roles, the enterprise, acting as client, can inform the provider of its own TGs through a simple TG registration. Consequently, the RIPP protocol allows a server to accept TG registrations from a client. Typically, when an enterprise acts as a client and registers its own TGs to the provider's server, those TGs do not accept registrations. In other words, the provider (e.g., Verizon) would not register TGs with the enterprise, even though the enterprise supports the RIPP server role.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.5">A handler is a representation of a physical hardware device, such as an SBC or IP PBX, or software, which acts as a client and can handle calls. Its primary role is to model the capabilities of the device - such as supported media types and codecs. The server needs this information in order to decide how media is to be handled for the call. For any particular call, there is a single handler. This handler is determined when the call is placed, and can change during the lifecycle of the call. For example, if a software SBC instance supporting G729 (which is a single handler) places a call, this SBC crashes, and a different SBC which only supports G.711 (which is a different handler) needs to step in and take over the call, the handler would change.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.6">Of course, a single physical device might be represented logically by one or more handlers; the mapping of a piece of software or hardware to a set of handlers is a matter of local implementation.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.7">A handler is always associated to a TG. As part of startup procedures, the client will register its handler with the TG.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.8">The final resource is a call, which is exactly what it sounds like. Calls are always associated with one and only TG. When a client creates a call, it does so in the context of the TG (i.e., call creation is a POST operation on a resource within the TG). Similarly, calls are associated with a single handler. When a client creates a call, it tells the server which handler is being used. This allows the server to compare the capabilities of the client with its own, and make a decision about what media the client should send with. The server communications this directive back to the client.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.3">In this use case, a key goal is to facilitate automated configuration of SIP trunks - a process which is, today, complex and error prone. This section discusses how RIPP can make such configuration as easy as a web app login.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.4">Consider a simple use case of a small business hosting a single IP PBX server, on a single machine, which is being used to make and receive calls. To set up the IP PBX for peering, the administrator would go to the configuration web application on the IP PBX.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.5">The  web application would have a page for selecting their trunking provider, with a list of supported providers. The user clicks on "Comcast". This begins a standard OAuth flow. The end user would be directed to the login page for Comcast, provide their credentials, and then be asked to authorize the IP PBX to access their Comcast account on their behalf. It would also display the permissions being requested (which Comcast would define and the IP PBX would request). In this case, probably the ability to make and recieve calls on their behalf. The user would click on "approve". The standard OAuth flow would then have deposited an OAuth access token on the IP PBX.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.6">The IP PBX would use the API defined below to obtain the list of TG URIs which are available for that user (which will often just be one), and present the user with the list of such trunks. The user would select one, if needed. At this point, the IP PBX now has the user's OAuth token and the provider TG URI, which are the only two pre-requisites for placing calls.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.7">No further configuration or setup is required. Using RIPP, the IP PBX will read an advertisement associated with the TG URI to learn its capabilities and features, create and upload its own TG URI and bearer token, and now be able to make and receive calls.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.1">In a related case, an enterprise has purchased voice services from Comcast as in the case above. However, rather than deploying an IP PBX, they wish to utilize the services of a Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS), such as Five9. In this example, Five9 supports a "BYO" model where the enterprise customer can purchase their voice services from another provider - such as Comcast, and then authorize a third party - in this case Five9 - to access them on their behalf.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.2">The flow works almost identically to the above case. The end user would visit five9.com, log in using their Five9 account, and click on the button to enable Comcast as their BYO provider. The user would be directed to log into their Comcast account, and then authorize Five9 to access their Comcast account for making and receiving calls. The user would approve, and then setup is complete.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.3">In essence, a side effect of using OAuth for authentication and authorization is that it enables a wide range of access models for telecommunications services.

<p id="rfc.section.8.3.p.1">In this case, a pair of telcos exchange voice traffic bidirectionally. Today this is done using SIP NNI interfaces as well as traditional SS7. This is accomplished in RIPP by having both telcos implement the provider role with a server only, as well as the customer role with a client only. When initiating outbound calls, the carrier would act as a customer, and when receiving them, as a provider. This enables a fully symmetric interconnect.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.3.p.2">The authentication and authorization flow differs in this use case from the ones above. Since it symmetric, each side will need to have an account set up for the other.

Consequently, the meeting provider returns a provider TG URI which corresponds to an "unauthenticated meeting join" TG.  </p>

This allows the origin server to determine who the customer is, and what TG(s) they are allowed to connect to. This is standard procedure for most web APIs when a query is performed - the set of resources returned depend on who is asking.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.1">If the client role is being played by a customer who wishes to receive incoming calls, it will need to implement the server role of RIPP. Its customer TG needs to be registered with the server. To do this, it performs a POST to the /customertgs resource on the RIPP root URI, and sets two parameters - its own URI, and a bearer token used for authorization of inbound requests.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.2">The customer TG URI has to be reachable by the server in order for the it to receive calls, and for security purposes it must also support TLS and present a valid certificate using the same trust chains configured into browsers. This specification envisions an extension which allows a client to receive calls without requiring it to run an HTTP server, thus allowing for it to run behind a NAT and not have a certificate.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.3">An example of a customer TG registration might be this: </p>
<pre>

    "destinations" : "+14085551*"
  }
}  
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.4">Notice how the directionality is "outbound" - this is because a TG only supports outbound calls, and from the perspective of the provider towards the customer, these are outbound. Similarly, note how the "destinations" parameter indicates the range of numbers reachable via this TG. The provider would validate that these are authorized based on prior business relationship, and reject them otherwise. For example, if the customer indicated it wanted to receive calls for numbers which were not obtained from that provider, the provider's terms of service may not allow that, and it would reject the request.  </p>

<a href="#rfc.section.9.5">9.5.</a> <a href="#handler-registration" id="handler-registration">Handler Registration</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.1">The handler is a representation of a set of capabilities that can be used when placing a call. The handler description is a semi-static declaration which declares features, codecs, and other properties of the handler. Handler descriptions are semi-static in that they do not change on a call by call basis. They change only when some kind of significant configuration change happens. For example, if an SBC receives an upgrrade to support a new codec, its handler description would change. Consequently, handler descriptions are expected to change perhaps a few times a year.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.2">A handler registration is created by having the client perform an HTTP POST operation to the /handlers resource on the TG URI. This operation creates a new handler instance on the server and returns its URI to the client. The client is expected to store this URI in order to make modifications at a later date (via PUT), or DELETE it. The handler can be destroyed at any time by the server. The client can discover this by subscribing to handler events, as described below.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.3">The handler description has a list of media sources and sinks that the endpoint has, and an ID for each which monotonically increases from 0. There are four types - mics, cameras, screens and speakers. An endpoint can have more than one of each. The case of PSTN gateways or traditional voice-only phones is simple - they have a single mic and a single speaker, mapping to sending and receiving audio. This is true for a PSTN gateway regardless of its capacity. In other words, if a PSTN gateway has a circuit switched line card with 100 ports, its handler description still has just one mic and one speaker.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.4">A three-screen telepresence system might have three screens, three mics, three cameras, and three speakers, and represents the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of complexity.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.5">For each source or sink, there are one or more parameter sets that can be specified. Each parameter in the parameter set has a name and a value. The value is always an integer from 0 to 2**31 - 1. Parameters are typically standardized and registered with IANA. The registration indicates the meaning of the values - their units and allowed values. Most importantly, the parameter is always expressed in a way where the value represents a maximum of some sort. This enables booleans (where the maximum is 1), integral ranges (where the maximum is a large-ish integer), or ordered enums (where the enum values correspond to integers in order). When a parameter is not specified, it takes on a default. Similarly, if the handler description document is not present, the default can be assumed for all parameters.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.6">Codec support is signaled using boolean parameters, with names that match the media subtypes defined in the IANA protocol registry for media types <a href="#RFC4855" class="xref">[RFC4855]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.7">The handler also contains meta-data which aids in handler selection and identification. These include device nicknames, image URLs, vendor names, and so on.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.7">Note how the audio directive has selected Opus.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.8">Another important consequence of this design is that media packets must be self-describing, without any kind of reference to a specific call. This is because the directive is constructed from the handler descriptions only, and the handler descriptions are semi-static. This means RIPP does not use dynamic payload types to identify codecs.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.9">Typically the response will also include a session cookie, bound to the call, to facilitate sticky session routing in HTTP proxies. This allows all further signalling and media to reach the same RIPP server that handled the initial request, while facilitating failover should that server go down.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.10">Once a call has been created, a pair of long-lived HTTP transactions is initiated from the client to the server for purposes of signalling. One is a GET to the /events resource on the call URI, retrieving call events from the server. The other is a PUT to the same /events URI, used by the cient to send call events to its peer. The combination of these two is called the signalling byway. HTTP/3 ensures zero RTT for setup of these transactions.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.11">Signaling commands are encoded into the signalling byway using streaming JSON in both directions. Each JSON object encodes an event and its parameters. A set of events common to all deployments of RIPP are defined for proceeding, alerting, answered, declined, ended, migrate, moved, and hello. An additional set are defined targeted at server to server cases, such as SIP trunking and inter-server peering. These include transfer-and-takeback.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.7">9.7.</a> <a href="#media-exchange" id="media-exchange">Media Exchange</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.7.p.1">Media exchange makes use of webtransport over HTTP3 <a href="#I-D.vvv-webtransport-http3" class="xref">[I-D.vvv-webtransport-http3]</a> when it is available, falling back to media byways when it is not.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.7.p.2">Once the call signaling is complete, the client attempts to open a webtransport session within the current HTTP3 connection. If this succeeds, the client and server can both send media chunks as webtransport datagrams.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.7.p.3">If the connection does not support webtransport, the client takes responsibility for opening media byways, which carry media chunks in both directions. Even though data can flow in both directions, a media byway is unidirectional in terms of media transmission. A forward media byway carries media from the client to the server, and a reverse byway carries media from the server to the client. These map directly to HTTP PUT and GET respectively, as they do for signaling byways.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.7.p.4">Unlike signaling byways where sequenced, in-order and reliable delivery is desired, these are undesirable for media.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.7.p.5">To eliminate them for media in the forward direction, for each and every media chunk to send, the client will create a new PUT transaction, send the media chunk, and immediately close the transaction. When run over HTTP3, this process takes place with zero-RTT. When the server receives the request and associated media chunk, it immediately sends a 200 OK response, includes a payload containing an acknowledgement media chunk, thus completing the transaction. Since HTTP3 will use a different QUIC stream for each HTTP transaction, each of these transactions occurs on a different stream, and therefore there is no HOL blocking between media packets.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.7.p.6">Receiving media is more complex, since the server cannot initiate HTTP requests in the reverse direction. To solve this, the client initiates 20 GET requests to the server to retrieve media chunks. These GET requests contain no body. The server, when it wishes to send a media chunk, chooses an existing GET transaction and sends the chunk as a response body. The client, upon receiving this, immediately opens a new GET transaction to replace the one it just received a response on. Consequently, a client always maintains 20 open GET transactions. [TODO: need to tune this and justify its value]. In addition, the client will include an acknowledgement media chunk along with its next media chunk in a PUT request.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.7.p.7">The use of acknowledgements provides the ability for clients and servers to elect to retransmit media as well as to generate detailed statistics on packet loss and delay on a packet-by-packet basis.  Consequently, the equivalent of RTCP sender and receiver reports are not needed.  </p>

<a href="#rfc.section.9.8">9.8.</a> <a href="#graceful-migration" id="graceful-migration">Graceful Migration</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.8.p.1">RIPP provides a simple technique for allowing a call to gracefully migrate from one client instance to another on a different host, or from one server instance to another on a different host. The client always performs the migration action. It can be instructed by the server to do so via a migrate event. Or, it can decide to do so on its own.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.8.p.2">The migration process is meant to support two key use cases - one is when a traditional HTTP load balancer is used, and the other is when there is none.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.8.p.3">In the first case, there is a traditional HTTP load balancer fronting a farm of HTTP origin servers. The migration operation is meant to move the call from one origin server to another. A server can request this in order to shed load. Or, it can request this because it has been instructed to shut down and restart, perhaps to perform a software upgrade, or to migrate its docker container to another node. It is assumed that some kind of shared database is used to store any state that needs to be passed between origin servers. RIPP is designed such that the only state which needs to be stored is call state, and not media state.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.8.p.4">In this use case, if the origin server handling the call does not desire to receive new calls (including the one it is about to migrate), it would be removed from the pool of available servers in the load balancer. The means for this is outside the scope of this specification. Then, the origin server sends a migration event to the client.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.8.p.5">This event can contain an IP to which the transaction should be directed. When an HTTP load balancer is used, this is not needed. This will cause the client to end its current signaling and media transactions. It then re-opens them, reusing the existing connection it has to the HTTP load balancer. Crucially, these new requests do NOT contain any session cookies. This means that the HTTP load balancer will send the new request to one of the available origin servers, which will no longer include the one which is being brought down for maintenance. The responses will contain session cookies in order to enable sticky session routing for subsequent requests for this call.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.8.p.6">Whether client or server initiated, when a migration occurs, both sides buffer their media packets and signaling events until the byways are ready to carry them. This enables the migrations to occur with literally no gap in media. The migration takes only a single RTT between client and server, and thus will often occur within the boundaries of jitter buffer depths.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.8.p.7">Note that the call state persists independently of the state of the HTTP connection or the byways embedded in HTTP transactions, so that a reconnect can continue where things left off. This is why, when a call migrates, the client does NOT initiate a new call, it opens signaling and media byways to the existing call URI it already has.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.9">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.9">9.9.</a> <a href="#nongraceful-migration" id="nongraceful-migration">Non-Graceful Migration</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.1">RIPP is also designed to handle failures of clients, servers and network connectivity issues, and to reconnect calls with a minimum of disruption. It does this by providing implementors with tools to enable such resiliency, without being overly prescriptive on exactly how it is implemented.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.2">The asymmetric nature of RIPP means that it is always the responsibility of the client to recover from network failures and failures of a downstream server or load balancer.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.3">The first failure case is that of a closure of the actual HTTP connection, either gracefully or non-gracefully. In this case, the client retries the connection with an exponential backoff, the backoff timer being another parameter which can be specified in the TG. Once the connection is re-established, it initiates the signaling and media byways, and will reuse any session cookies it had previously received.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.4">RIPP also requires clients to send keepalive signaling events periodically for each call, and the server responds to these events. If the client ceases to receive the server keepalives for a certain duration (a value again that has a default but which can be tuned in the TG handler description), it treats this identically to a request for a migration. This will cause it to end its signaling and media byway transactions, and re-initiate them without session cookies.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.5">Finally, the media byways are used for rapid failure detection. If the client fails to receive acknowledgements for the media it has sent for period of time (this timer not being subject to standardization as it is entirely a matter of local configuration), the client can re-establish the signaling and media byways as if it were a migration.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.6">The above cases handle failures in the network and of the origin servers and intermediate load balancers. If there was a failure of the origin server and it was not able to recover sufficient call state for re-establishment, it rejects the re-establishment of the media and signaling byways. This causes a call termination from the perspective of the client, which it would typically pass upstream if needed, as an event. And indeed for the origin server to recover, it will need to stash state. Specifically, it will need to stash the callID and the downstream entity to which the call was set when it was established. If the downstream entity is a RIPP server, the TG URI, call URI, selected IP address (from either DNS or using the IP in the advertiseent), and session cookie are stored. These facilitate reconnection to the same downstream instance.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.7">In inter-domain peering arrangements, such as enterprise voice trunking or inter-carrier NNI voice peering, both sides will typically have a cluster of software agents (VMs, docker containers, bare-metal servers, dedicated hardware products, or whatever) acting as both clients and servers. Consequently, we need to consider what happens to the client transactions when these fail.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.8">In such a case, failure recovery is always delegated to the upstream client. In this case, let us assume that the client had this cluster of agents at its perimeter. It would be receiving calls from some further upstream elements. If those elements were using RIPP, it would mean that the roles were reversed - a particular agent was acting as a server to receive a call, and then as a client to send it downstream. If that agent fails, the upstream client would detect this, and migrate to a different agent. This new agent - which has no in-memory state for the call - would look up the state of the call in some shared database, see where it was routed (in this case, to the TG), and retrieve the session cookie which had also been stored after the call was established. This new agent then re-establishes the media and signaling byways, perhaps even opening a fresh HTTP connection to do so. The use of the session cookie enables the byways to be re-established to the server's origin server that has been, and is still - handling the call.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.9">This allows a chain of RIPP clients and servers in back-to-back configuration to recover from failures of any intermediate element without dropping calls. Furthermore, failure detection and recovery are rapid, especially when using load balancers. When an origin server fails, the client can still reuse its connection to the load balancer, such that connection establishment is not needed. Indeed, the time to recover from failure is only 1/2 RTT between client and server, once the client has detected the downstream failure.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.9.p.10">Of course, the downstream element may be SIP-based and not RIPP. In such a case, INVITE with Replaces is a good solution, and vendors of highly reliable SIP gear are encouraged to support it.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.10.11.p.1">The state of the connection, the QUIC streams, and byways, is separate from the state of the call. The client MAY terminate an HTTP connection or byway at any time, and re-establish it. Similarly, the server or client may end the a byway at any time, neither affects call state directly.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.11.p.2">If a byway ends or the connection breaks or is migrated, the client MUST re-initiate the byways immediately, or risk loss of media and signalling events. However, to deal with the fact that re-establishment takes time, both client and server MUST buffer their signalling and media streams for at least 5 seconds, and then once the connections and byways are re-established, it sends all buffered data immediately.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.11.p.3">A server MUST maintain a timer, with a value equal to 30 seconds, for which it will hold the call in its current state without any active signalling byway. If the server does not receive a signalling byway before the expiration of this timer, it MUST consider the call as ended. Once the call has ended, the call resource SHOULD be destroyed.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.11.p.4">If the server receives a signalling or media byway for a call that is TERMINATED, it MUST reject the transaction with an 404 response code, since the resource no longer exists.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.11.p.5">Note that it is the sole responsibility of the client to make sure byways are re-established if they fail unexpectedly.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.10.12.p.1">A client MAY initiate a GET request against the /calls resource in the TG. The server MUST return a body with the list of all calls which currently exist on the server. This is just a list of call URI. This is useful for a client which restarts and wishes to rebuild its view of call state.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.10.13.p.1">A server MAY initiate a call migration at any time for a specific call. To do so, it MUST send a migration event to the client over the signaling byway. The client MUST honor this request for migration. The client MAY choose to migrate the call to a different server at any time.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.13.p.2">To perform the migration, the client MUST end all outstanding HTTP transactions for the call (signaling and media byways). It MUST initiate a new signaling byway for the call, targeting the IP if it has been specified by the server. This may require the client to open a new HTTP connection, if it does not already have one open to the target. The client MUST NOT include a session cookie in the POST to /events. This is essential to cause the request to route to a different instance behind the load balancer, which will typically be configured with sticky routing. The server MAY respond to this request with a new session cookie. The client MUST NOT initiate forward or reverse media byways  until the client receives response headers to the signaling byway creation. This is to enable session cookies to be included in these requests for sticky routing.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.13.p.3">The client SHOULD cache all media that the client wishes to transmit, but was unable to do so during the migration. The media MUST then be sent in a burst once the media byways are re-established. This ensures there is no packet loss (though there will be jitter) during the migration period.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.10.14.p.1">If the origin server or HTTP load balancer fails unexpectedly, this is handled by the client. If the client (1) receives a reset on the signaling byway, or (2) receives no media packets for 5s, or (3) receives no acknowledgements for media packets it has sent for 1s, or (4) receives a ungraceful closure of the HTTP connection, it MUST initiate a migration as defined in the prior section.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.1">RIPP is designed to be easy to gateway from SIP. The expectation is that RIPP will be implemented in SBCs and softswitches. A SIP to RIPP gateway has to be call-stateful, acting as a B2BUA, in order to gateway to RIPP. Furthermore, a SIP to RIPP gateway has to act as a media termination point in SIP. It has to perform any SRTP decryption and encryption, and it must de-packetize RTP packets to extract their timestamps, sequence numbers, and codec types.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.2">SIP to RIPP gateways are not transparent. SIP header fields which are unknown or do not map to RIPP functionality as described here, gets discarded.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.3">Any configuration and provisioning for RIPP happens ahead of receipt or transmission of SIP calls. Consequently, the logic described here applies at the point that a gateway receives a SIP INVITE on the SIP side, or receives a POST to the RIPP trunk URI on the RIPP side.  </p>
