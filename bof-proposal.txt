Description:
Though extremely successful and deployed on massive scales, the
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) - as a 20 year old protocol - is
showing its age. It is difficult to deploy SIP technologies into
modern public cloud platforms. Its usage of raw IPs and ports, domain-specific
load balancing techniques, and connection-oriented state model make it incompatible
with exisiting services like global load balancers, autoscaling, service meshes,
and so on. 


As such, the goal of this BoF is to create a new protocol that 
enables signaling and real-time interactive media to operate natively
on top of the modern web platforms. At a high level, this means:

1. It uses HTTP URLs for addressing, and HTTP for transmission of signaling and media.

2. It follows the HTTP connectionless model, in that, clients can refresh
their state and manipulate said state, from any number of clients.

3. It aligns signaling and media state into a single piece of state,
allowing clients to manipulate it with RPC operations.

4. It uses modern HTTP-based cloud security techniques, including OAuth,
server-side TLS, and so on.

5. It uses modern techniques for load balancing and high availability
commonly deployed in scaled web cloud environments.

6. It makes use of existing HTTP RPC techniques and message formatting.

7. It follows modern web practice and makes security features mandatory,
not optional (including e2e media encryption, even when media flows HbH)


The recent efforts to standardize HTTP3 using QUIC make it possible to 
achieve the above without unacceptable latency and HOL blocking, inherent
in TCP-based protocols.


To remedy this, a design team put together a draft specification
called RIPP, which takes advantage of HTTP3 and QUIC to enable
real-time communications over these protocols without extending or
changing them.

The purpose of the BoF is to gain consensus on the formation of a
working group to work on this problem. A strong goal is to 
build code and specifications simultaneously.
