                            RIPP WebRTC Mode
                draft-rosenberg-dispatch-ripp-inbound-00

Abstract

   The Real-Time Internet Peering Protocol (RIPP) defines a technique
   for establishing, terminating and otherwise managing calls between
   entities in differing administrative domains.  The RIPP Inbound
   extension brings this to end clients, such as a browser.  However, it
   defines a different technique for media that cannot directly use the
   webRTC APIs, and require a change to them.  This specification
   provides an extension to RIPP for webRTC compatibility, enabling
   media to flow from browser to server as is done with RIPP, or from
   browser to browser.  It also discusses techniques for sending e2e
   encrypted media.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

3.  Overview of Operation

   Basic idea: The TG indicates that this compatibility mode is
   supported on the TG.  The handler is also indicates that this mode is
   supported.  The handler includes its own ICE candidates.  This means
   we provide the ICE candidates at "registration" time and not before
   the call.  This is necessary to facilitate the many call move and
   other operations in RIPP-inbound.  This also means the browser needs
   to keep them fresh all of the time, rather than just before the call
   [[is this posible with current API??]].

   Since the media is sent by DTLS-SRTP and not embedded as media chunks
   in a client-to-server HTTPS connection, the browser includes its
   fingerprint in the handler as well.

   To initiate this compatibility mode for media, the server indicates
   as such in the directive.  It can only put it in a directive if the
   handler that is selected, supports the mode.  The directive includes
   the ICE candidates from the peer.  This will trigger the client to
   perform ICE and send media (which will be DTLS-SRTP).

   RIPP itself doesnt convey the ICE candidates in the server to server
   link, since its only through handler whih is static for a device and
   not per-call.  So we'd either need to move them, develop a separate
   way to convey them, or assume SIP or some other technique is used for
   server to server calls.

   Suggest we also require a well-known port for media, and we'll need
   an RTP headr extension to convey the callID since its included inband
   in RIPP.
