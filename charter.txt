This working group will standardize a protocol, capable of operating
atop HTTP/3, which supports real-time voice and
video communications, including signaling, media
negotiation, and transmission of media packets.

The primary rationale for this new protocol is to enable deployment of
real-time communications services on modern "cloud"
systems. These systems are built around HTTP, and for HTTP-based
applications, they enable load balancing, HA, auto-scaling, and so
on. However, real-time communications protocols are based on SIP and
RTP, and they cannot take advantage of these HTTP-based
capabilities. 

The goals is not to create all the featues of SIP and redo them - the goal is to allow real time voice and video flows. 

The baseline protocol uses the underling  HTTP techniques for authentication and hop by hop enction and will allow for e2e media encryption,
although keying is out of scope, and is expected to be
handled by other protocols such as MLS. 

Beyond the core transport, the group will standardize an extension
to the baseline protocol which enables real-time communcations for enterprise to
telco calling (often called SIP trunking) and telco to telco calling
(often called NNI). It will also enable the automated configuration of
this connectivity; while current solutions for inter-company communications
depend heavily on manual provisioning and configuration of IP
addresses, codecs, capabilities, routing logic, and firewall rules, 
the new protocol must include any information conveyance between
providers that is needed for real-time
communications. This extension will also utilize STIR to the greatest
extent possible, and make "secure caller ID" an integral part of the
specification. 

P2P media - in or out ? If in, ICE or something else ? 

This protocol shouidl be implementable in browsers. 

The group will do its work in conjunction with active development
efforts, so that implementation experience feeds directly into
protocol development. 

Coordinate with Webtranport , QUIC, HTTP. 

Milestones:
